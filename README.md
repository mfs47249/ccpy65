beginning checkin:

ccpy65 is at the first place educational c-compiler for small 6502/65c02 Computers
like the Breadboard Computer from Ben Eater. I startet the project for fun some
years ago, but due to a lack of time, i am not able to extend functionality.

If you are interested in building a compiler you are welcome to improve the
project, learn something new ore even better, improve the functionality.

And there is a lot of improvement possible, because at the moment, there is only
a very very tiny subset of the c-language implementet. May be it is better to beginn
from the scratch then extending the existing compiler.
